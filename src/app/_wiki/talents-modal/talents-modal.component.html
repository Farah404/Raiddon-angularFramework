    <p>A talent is an additional class-specific ability or power that requires talent points to gain or improve.
        Each class has three Talent Trees to choose from. With the upcoming expansion World of Warcraft: Mists of
        Pandaria Mists of Pandaria, there will be only one tree for each class, and points will be done away with.
        However, there will still be three different specializations (with the exception of druids, who will then
        have four). </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;
    text-justify: inter-word;">The reason talents are included is so that each player of the same class will be slightly different as far as how
        their skills work and how effective they are in certain areas. Certain talents are beneficial for leveling,
        while others help you do better in PvP, and others still can help you with Raiding. Without this system, each
        class character would be identical, which would remove some of the variety of the gameplay. It's up to the
        player to make his character different by specializing in the character's different Talents. </p>

    <p>Advice on picking your talents:</p>
    <ul class="ms-5">
        <li>
            Pick one thing to do and stick with it. If you try to (for example) get a bit of healing ability and a bit
            of tanking ability, you'll probably end up bad at both.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any ability that activates "whenever you are critically hit" is a PvP talent (PvE players won't get
            critically hit much) and can be safely skipped if you aren't doing much PvP.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any ability that gradually applies several stacks of a buff or debuff is designed for boss fights, which
            last long enough for these abilities to reach a full stack. When you're leveling, your fights usually won't
            last long enough, so skip these talents if there's something better available.
        </li>
        <li>
            There's no such thing as a bad spec (except in very few cases). That's still no excuse to bring your PvP
            spec into an end-game raid, however. Please be aware of the strengths (and purpose) of your talent build,
            and utilize them accordingly.
        </li>
    </ul>
